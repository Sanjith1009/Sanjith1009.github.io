                        Hello. My name is Sanjith Menon. I am going to be a 10th grader at Arcadia High School. I am 14 years old. I enjoy playing basketball (as you can see by my profile picture) and reading books. I have not had much coding experience prior to UCLA Summer Discovery. My computer programming class taught me a lot about the complexities of game design and how to build websites using HTML.

                            In this two week course, we learned a lot about game design using Unity. We worked on many projects, ranging in difficulty from just creating a scene to creating a working terrain complete with a driving car. It was both fun and frustrating because at times it didn't work properly. The times when it did work, however, I enjoyed greatly (especially the car game).

                                We also worked on developing a website using Visual Studio Code. It was a fun and gratifying experience to watch as what I coded came into existence on the website. I enjoyed it very much and though sometimes it didn't work, once the issues were fixed the result was great. I learned a lot about HTML 5 in this experience.

                                As a whole, the summer discover experience was interesting. It was nice to learn about computer programming and see UCLA's campus for the first time. However, as a commuter student, the drive was long and filled with traffic. That and the fact that I wasn't a very socialable person meant the first week of the program wasn't very fun for me. I slowly learned to talk to more people and I finally met a few residential kids. I didn't participate in any activity other than a basketball tournament, opting instead to just go home. The experience taught that no matter where you are, it is important to make friends quickly.
